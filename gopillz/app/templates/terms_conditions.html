        <br /><br /><b>COOKIES</b><br />
        To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
        "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign
        each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID)
        to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified
        Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through
        registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are,
        even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
        information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example
        of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot
        read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own
        cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we
        do not control.

        <br /><br />Our web servers automatically collect limited information
        about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP
        address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets
        computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such
        as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you
        personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon

        We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without
        obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited
        circumstances:

        <br /><br />(a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court

        Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
        measures.

        <br /><br /><b>INFORMATION SECURITY</b><br />
        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
        access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
        These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
        processing practices and security measures, including appropriate
        encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
        access to systems where we store personal data.

        <br /><br />All information gathered on our Website is securely stored
        within our controlled database. The database is stored on servers
        secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected
        and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures
        are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the
        security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you
        supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
        Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to
        the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.

        <br /><br />However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may
        change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary
        future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will
        always be consistent with the policy under which the information was
        collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
